## 10/4/2025 5 PM - finished the schematic

Set up the project, added the key matrix and seedstudio, and got them added to the schematic [1hr]
Researched how to make a USB hub, how the USB protocol worked, chose [this](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/USB2512) IC, added a USB-C upstream, and two USB-A downstream [1hr 45min]
Had a lot of fun starting a larger project: my only other real experience with PCBs was the Macropad from Highway (which was also fun). I'm now looking to work on routing, then CAD  

## 10/4/2025 6 PM - assigned footprints, fixed electrical rules checker errors

I fixed the ERC errors by adding no connect flags to the unused pins, I assigned the footprints for all the components, and initialized the PCB with all the components. I also forgot to add the mounting holes and mousebites to the last commit, so I added those as well. Next commit will be routing all the components, then full CAD, then firmware (looking to use KMK as that's what I used for the Macropad)

Note: Game of Thrones OST is great for PCB work :), Celeste is good too (used that last commit)
ps. I always include the Windows Stopwatch screenshot as proof of how long I spent working on each commit  

## 10/4/2025 10 PM - worked on routing the pcb

This took much longer than I expected, but it was lots of fun. I started by organising all the components on the PCB, which took about an hour on its own. I then routed the processors on top for about an hour, and, lastly, routed the keys for the last hour. All I have left to route are the ~20 traces going between the halves of the board. I'm quite happy I was able to keep this to two layers. I thought I'd have to bump it up to three for the areas around the USB hub's IC. It's messy, but I think it'll work

 P.S. Skyward Sword music is great too
can't wait to type on the new keeb
  

## 10/5/2025 - finished routing, added the back Silkscreen, fixed DRC  

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTg5LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--1173dc38acde3b0dfde7d2d5e4572d683b905760/image.png)
I finished the leftover routing, added some images to the back silkscreen, and went through the DRC errors. There are still some problems with the USB-C port's clearance, but otherwise, the PCB is almost done. I'll try to get the Cad and FW done this week so I can wrap up and submit on Sat. PCB way says ~54$ for the pcb.
