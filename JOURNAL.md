Set up the project, added the key matrix and seedstudio, and got them added to the schematic [1hr]
Researched how to make a USB hub, how the USB protocol worked, chose [this](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/USB2512) IC, added a USB-C upstream, and two USB-A downstream [1hr 45min]
Had a lot of fun starting a larger project: my only other real experience with PCBs was the Macropad from Highway (which was also fun). I'm now looking to work on routing, then CAD  

## 10/4/2025 6 PM - assigned footprints, fixed electrical rules checker errors

I fixed the ERC errors by adding no connect flags to the unused pins, I assigned the footprints for all the components, and initialized the PCB with all the components. I also forgot to add the mounting holes and mousebites to the last commit, so I added those as well. Next commit will be routing all the components, then full CAD, then firmware (looking to use KMK as that's what I used for the Macropad)

Note: Game of Thrones OST is great for PCB work :), Celeste is good too (used that last commit)
ps. I always include the Windows Stopwatch screenshot as proof of how long I spent working on each commit
