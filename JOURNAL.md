Set up the project, added the key matrix and seedstudio, and got them added to the schematic [1hr]
Researched how to make a USB hub, how the USB protocol worked, chose [this](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/USB2512) IC, added a USB-C upstream, and two USB-A downstream [1hr 45min]
Had a lot of fun starting a larger project: my only other real experience with PCBs was the Macropad from Highway (which was also fun). I'm now looking to work on routing, then CAD
